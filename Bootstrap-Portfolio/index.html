                <p>Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Another one. Give thanks to the most high. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm.</p>
                <p>I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Lion! They don’t want us to win. Cloth talk. Mogul talk. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.</p>
